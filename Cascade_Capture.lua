    A. FRAMING & CAPTURE
    1. Triggering Slave (3, 2, 1) sequentially in a hardware triggered mode.
    2. Triggering Master in a software triggered mode.
    
    B. TRANSFERRING FILES
    1. The data is stored in file(s) with max cap placed at 2 GB.
    2. The files can be retrieved from the SSD (/mnt/ssd folder) using WinSCP.

Note: Update lines 17 to 43 as needed before using this script.
    
--]]

-- Note: "capture_time"  is a timeout for this script alone to exit - it does not control the actual duration of capture.
-- The actual capture duration depends on the configured frame time and number of frames

capture_time					=	3000                             -- ms
inter_loop_time					=	2000							 -- ms
num_loops						=	1


-- Note: Change the following three parameters as desired:
-- n_files_allocation: is the number of files to preallocate on the SSD.
-- 		This improves capture reliability by not having frame drops while switching files.
--		The tradeoff is that each file is a fixed 2047 MB even if a smaller number of frames are captured.
--		Pre-allocate as many files as needed based on (size_per_frame * number_of_frames) to be captured
-- data_packaging: select whether to use 16-bit ADC data as is, or drop 4 lsbits and save 4*12-bit numbers in a packed form
--		This allows a higher frame rate to be achieved, at the expense of some post-processing to unpack the data later.
--		(Matlab should still be able to unpack the data using the '*ubit12' argument to fread instead of 'uint16')
--		The default is no-packing, for simplicity
-- capture_directory: is the filename under which captures are stored on the SSD
--		and is also the directory to which files will be transferred back to the host
--		The captures are copied to the PostProc folder within mmWave Studio
--		Note: If this script is called multiple times without changing the directory name, then all captured files will be in the same directory.
--			with filename suffixes incremented automatically. It may be hard to know which captured files correspond to which run of the script.
--		Note: It is strongly recommended to change this directory name between captures.
